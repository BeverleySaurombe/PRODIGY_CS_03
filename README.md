Task-03: PASSWORD COMPLEXITY CHECKER

WHAT IS PASSWORD COMPLEXITY?

Password complexity or  password strength, is a way of measuring how difficult a password is to guess, especially against brute-force attacks. 
Brute-force attack is a form of cyberattack where computer software is engineered to eventually guess a password correctly, often by calculating thousands of possibilities through names, words, letters, symbols, and information gathered from previous password breaches. 
In other words, it refers to requirements that gauge how secure it is. 
The greater the password complexity, the more secure the password is against guessing and similar attacks. 

WHAT MAKES A PASSWORD COMPLEX?

According to Microsoft, a strong password is:
>At least 12 characters long but 14 or more is better.
>A combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
>Not a word that can be found in a dictionary or the name of a person, character, product, or organization.
>Significantly different from your previous passwords.
>Easy for you to remember but difficult for others to guess.

Now, if we are to look at this list of how a password should be for it to be secure, one could say that it is not easy to come up with a complex password. 
Almost every word can be found in the dictionary and a password that I can remember is usually the name of a person, character, product or organization! So how exactly is one supposed to come up with a complex password?

I will start with considering my name, Beverley Saurombe. 
The length of both my name and surname is 16 excluding the space, so that is good. 
It has a combination of both uppercase letters and lowercase letters, but no numbers and symbols.
It is easy for me to remember but not so difficult for others to guess. 
The problem is that this is my name and it makes it not complex right away. So what now?

Let us look into the second one which says "A combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols."
It is true that my name as a password can be easy to guess, but what if I write it in a 'not-so-common' way by using a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols in an attempt to make it complex.

Let us try that, so instead of 'BeverleySaurombe', I can use Be\/er|_ey$@ur0mbe.

Is it still my name?_Yes, but is it still easy for others to guess?_No. 
It is definitely not found in the dictionary and it is a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. There you have it, a complex password, so it is not difficult to come up with a complex password.

WHAT IS A PASSWORD COMPLEXITY CHECKER?
A password complexity checker is a tool that evaluates the strength of digital passwords. The checker assesses the password's resilience to being guessed outright or cracked by cybercriminals using computer-automated hacking tools.
